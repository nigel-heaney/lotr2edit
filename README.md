Lords of the Realm II - Game file editor
========================================

![screenshot1](lotr2_edit.png)

A game file editor that is written in python.  This program will allow you to edit Gold, Stone, Wood, Iron and weapons (Armor, Swords, Bows and crossbows).

Many years ago I wrote the same thing in Turbo Pascal and would even allow you to edit individual counties but I lost the source for this and so wrote it again in Python.

This program is tested on Linux and Windows.


Usage
=====

```
./lotr2edit.py -h
